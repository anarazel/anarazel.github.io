      <description>One fairly common complaint about postgres is that is that each connection uses too much memory. Often made when comparing postgres&#39; connection model to one where each connection is assigned a dedicated thread, instead of the current model where each connection has a dedicated process.
To be clear: This is a worthwhile discussion to have. And there are several important improvements we could make to reduce memory usage.
That said, I think one common cause of these concerns is that the easy ways to measure the memory usage of a postgres backend, like top and ps, are quite misleading.</description>
